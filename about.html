<p>I'm Darragh Clabby from Dublin, Ireland. I studied mechanical engineering at University College Dublin before completing a PhD at Queen's University Belfast on the topic of marine renewable energy. Since completing my PhD I've worked for marine renewable technology developers, specifically in the fields of tidal energy conversion (OpenHydro) and wave energy conversion (Resolute Marine Energy).</p>
