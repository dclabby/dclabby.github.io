                <p> This post summarizes a project that I undertook for a course on databases. The project brief was to design and implement a database for an online 
                    retailer, and to implement specific queries and actions on the database. I’ve split the post into two parts. Part 1 describes the design and 
                    implementation of the database. <a href="blog_211021_databasepart2.html">Part 2</a> describes the development of SQL statements to query the database, and creation of 
                    views and stored procedures to achieve certain goals.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                In this part I’ll discuss the design and implementation of the database. This will include: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identification of requirements for the database;</li>
                <li>Specification of tables comprising the database;</li>
                <li>Development of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD);</li>
                <li>Creation of the database using Data Definition Language (DDL);</li>
                <li>Generation of data sets using <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">mockaroo</a>;</li>
                <li>Population of the database with generated data using Data Manipulation Language (DML)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
            <hr>
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>The design phase was implemented according to the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the client’s requirements;</li>
                <li>Identify the tables necessary to implement the database;</li>
                <li>Use an Entity Relationship Diagram to specify relationships between the database’s tables.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>The first step in any design process is to understand the client’s requirements. In this case the client was an online retailer. The objective 
                of the retailer is to provide customers with a choice of products to suit their needs, to process orders from customers, and to dispatch products 
                to customers in a timely manner. Since the retailer turns over high volumes of orders, a database was required to manage orders. The database shall 
                be required to store relevant information about: the customers (e.g. name, address, etc.); orders placed by customers (items ordered, quantities of items);
                members of staff, including the orders that they fulfilled; items of stock (e.g. their unit price, quantity held in stock; and suppliers of stock items.
            </p>

            <p>The structure of a customer’s order may be summarized as follows: The order is composed of one or more order items; An order item consists of a single 
                item of stock and a quantity (equal to one or more); An order’s total cost is calculated as the sum of each item’s value, where an item’s value is 
                calculated as the product of the item’s unit price and its quantity.
            </p>

            <p>For the purpose of this project, some simplifying assumptions were made, namely that: the database does not allow for discounted order prices; and
                The database does not track returned items.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Database Tables</h2>
            <p>The next step in designing the database is to identify the tables that are required, and to define them in terms of their fields, data types, and 
                primary/foreign keys. The following tables were identified:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customers: this table stores details of the retailer’s customers;</li>
                <li>Staff: this table stores details of the retailer’s staff;</li>
                <li>Suppliers: this table stores details of the retailer’s suppliers;</li>
                <li>Orders: this table stores details of orders placed by customers. It links to the Customers table to record the customer that placed the order, 
                    and the Staff table to identify the member of staff that fulfilled the order;</li>
                <li>OrderItems: This table stores details of items comprising an order. It links to the OrderItems table to identify the order, and the Stock table 
                    to identify the stock item;</li>
                <li>Stock: This table stores details of items of stock, including unit price and quantity in stock. It links to the Suppliers table to identify the 
                    supplier for each item of stock.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Entity Relationship Diagram
            </h2>
            <p>An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) describes the relationships between tables of the database. For the tables describes in the previous section 
                the ERD is shown below.

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="resources/Entity Relationship Diagram3.jpg" alt="ERD for the database">
            </div>
            <p>The relationships shown in the ERD are described below</p>
            

            <h3>Customer/Order</h3>
            <p>The customer places an order: this is represented by the link from CustomerID as a primary key in the Customers table, to CustomerID as a foreign key 
                in the Orders table. The relationship is “one to many” as a single customer may place many orders;
            </p>

            <h3>Staff/Order</h3>
            <p>A member of staff is responsible for the order: this is represented by the link from StaffID as a primary key in the Staff table, to StaffID as a 
                foreign key in the Orders table. The relationship is “one to many” as a single staff member may fulfill many orders;
            </p>

            <h3>Order/Item</h3>
            <p>An order consists of items: this is represented by the link from OrderID as a primary key in the Orders table, to OrderID as a foreign key in the 
                OrderItems table. The relationship is “one to many” as a single order may consist of many order items;
            </p>

            <h3>Item/Stock</h3>
            <p>Order items consist of stock items: this is represented by the link from StockID as a primary key in the Stock table, to StockID as a foreign key in 
                the OrderItems table. The relationship is “one to many” as a single item of stock may appear across many order items;
            </p>

            <h3>Stock/Supplier</h3>
            <p>Items of stock are supplied by suppliers: this is represented by the link from SupplierID as a primary key in the Suppliers table, to SupplierID as a 
                foreign key in the Stock table. The relationship is “one to many” as a single supplier may supply many items of stock;

            <h1>Implementation</h1>
            <p>Implementation of the database involved: generation of data sets; creation of the database and its tables; and population of the tables with the generated data sets.
            </p>

            <h2>Generating Data Sets</h2>
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/" target="_blank">mockaroo</a> to generate data sets for this project. This online tool allows you to specify 
                field names and data types corresponding to tables that you intend to populate. It will generate up to 1000 rows and then assign random values to 
                each field. The results can be saved as a sql file which contain the DDL command to create a table, and the DML commands to populate it with the 
                generated data.
            </p>

            <p>For this project I decided to generate two data sets: The validation data set was a small data set that I could use to manually validate queries. 
                The test data set was a larger data set that would be intended to represent the real database. For each data set, the number of rows in each table 
                was defined as follows:
            </p>
            <table class="alt-row">
                <tr>
                    <th>Table</th>
                    <th>No. Rows in Validation Data Set</th>
                    <th>No. Rows in Test Data Set</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Customers</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Staff</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Suppliers</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>100</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Orders</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>400</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>OrderItems</td>
                    <td>50</td>
                    <td>1000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stock</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The rationale behind this assignment of rows per table was to ensure that the queries to be implemented later would yield interesting results. For 
                example, I could have defined all tables in the test data set to have 1000 rows (based on the limit imposed by mockaroo). But this would have 
                resulted in a lot of “one to one” relationships, e.g. one customer makes one order containing one item. This really isn’t of much interest when we 
                get to writing queries to the database. Rather, I wanted to ensure that the intended “one to many” relationships were actually realized. So, by 
                setting no. customers less than no. orders less than no. order items, we should get plenty of cases where a customer has placed multiple orders and 
                each of those orders contain multiple items… which will be a lot more interesting when we start to query the database!
            </p>

            <h2>Creating the Database</h2>
            <p>To create the test and validation databases I used the following DDL (Data Definition Language) commands:<br>
            <code>
                CREATE DATABASE ValData;<br>
                CREATE DATABASE TestData;
            </code></p>

            <p>I then created tables in the database according to the database design described earlier. Below is the command to create the Customers table:<br>
                <code>
                    CREATE table Customers (</br>
                    CustomerID INT,</br>
                    FirstName VARCHAR(50),</br>
                    LastName VARCHAR(50),</br>
                    BillingAddress VARCHAR(50),</br>
                    DeliveryAddress VARCHAR(50),</br>
                    Email VARCHAR(50),</br>
                    PhoneNo VARCHAR(50),PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID)<br>
                    );
                </code>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Populating the Database</h2>
            <p>Finally, to complete implementation of the database the tables need to be populated. This is done by implementing the DML commands (INSERT statements) 
                produced as part of the data generation phase (i.e. downloaded from mockaroo). An example statement to populate a row of the Customers table is given 
                as follows:<br>
                <code>
                    insert into Customers <br>
                    (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, BillingAddress, DeliveryAddress, Email, PhoneNo) <br>
                    values <br>
                    (1, 'Arlee', 'Mapplethorpe', '681 Bartillon Center', '35 Dovetail Circle', 'amapplethorpe0@spotify.com', '944-451-0032');
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>And there we have it, we’ve designed, created, and populated the database!</p>
            <br>

            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>So, in this post I’ve discussed the design and implementation of a database. As part of the design I described the requirements of the database. 
                I used these requirements to specify the tables that would comprise the database, and I illustrated the relationships between the tables using an ERD. 
                Following the design phase I generated synthetic data for each table using mockaroo. I then created the database and its tables using DDL, and inserted 
                the synthetic data into the database using DML. With that complete, we can move on to the interesting stuff – using SQL to query the database and to 
                perform actions on it. This will be the topic for <a href="blog_211021_databasepart2.html">Part 2</a> where I’ll discuss some queries, as well as creation of views and stored procedures.
