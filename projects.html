            <p> Grid Forecaster is an application that uses machine learning algorithms to
                generate forecasts for Ireland’s electricity power demand, and wind generated
                power. Four separate machine learning models were trained on system demand
                and wind generation data obtained from Eirgrid’s Smart Grid Dashboard. Time
                series forecasts were generated over a 24 hour period at 1 hour resolution. They
                were evaluated on a test data set of 1.5 years (representing 20% of the total data
                set). The results showed excellent accuracy for system demand, with coefficients
                of determination greater than 0.95 for all four models. In the case of wind
                generation the results were much poorer, with R 2 scores of 0.42 for three of the
                four models, and as low as 0.34 for one of the models. The poor results for wind
                generation were attributed to the fact that meteorological data (wind speed, wind
                direction) remains to be included as part of feature engineering (work in this area
                is ongoing). Given the excellent results observed for system demand, it is
                expected that significant improvement will be achieved for wind generation
                forecasts once meteorological data is incorporated in feature engineering.

            <p> This project explores the application of the TextRank algorithm to the task of automatic text summarization. 
                The TextRank algorithm ranks the importance of sentences in a text by representing the text as a graph, with 
                vertices representing sentences and edges representing similarity between sentences. The texts to be 
                summarized were news articles taken from the Daily Mail data set. Each text contained in the data set is 
                accompanied by a human generated summary which may be used as reference summary against which automatically 
                generated summaries may be assessed. Summarization was implemented according to five methods, three of which 
                employed the TextRank algorithm. The aim of this work was to assess how the basic TextRank method compared to 
                the simpler TF-IDF method; and to assess whether sentence embedding and unsupervised classification could be 
                employed to further improve performance. The results suggest that the basic TextRank performed best (highest 
                accuracy, lowest computational demand). The methods employing sentence embedding and unsupervised classification 
                did not deliver further performance improvements.

                by training a convolutional neural network on labelled
